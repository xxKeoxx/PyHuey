This is a work in progress and does not currently work.  Just pushed for me to save my work.

Plans for this repo are as folows:
Will use token based auth for PyHuey work flows
Tokens for Hue user account will be securely stored and retrieved.
First thing I want to takle is disableing a hue motion sensor when from an endpoint so I can use external apps like homekit to disable hue motion sensors.
Plans are to run in docker using fastapi uvicorn
